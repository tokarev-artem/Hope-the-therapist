## üîß Technical Implementation

This project implements a bidirectional WebSocket-based audio streaming application that integrates with Amazon Nova Sonic model for real-time speech-to-speech conversion. The application enables natural conversational interactions through a web interface while leveraging Amazon's powerful Nova Sonic model for processing and generating empathetic responses.

The system consists of a server that handles the bidirectional streaming and AWS Bedrock integration, paired with a modern web client that manages audio streaming and user interactions. Key technical features include real-time audio streaming, integration with Amazon Nova Sonic model, bidirectional communication handling, persistent conversation memory, and a responsive web interface.

## Usage Instructions
### Prerequisites
- Node.js (v14 or higher)
- AWS Account with Bedrock access
- AWS CLI configured with appropriate credentials
- Modern web browser with WebAudio API support


### Installation
1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/tokarev-artem/Hope-the-therapist.git
cd Hope-the-therapist
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

3. Configure AWS credentials:
```bash
# Configure AWS CLI with your credentials
export AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=""
export AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=""
export AWS_SESSION_TOKEN=""
```

**Note**: For demo purposes, no additional configuration is needed. The application uses default encryption keys and will work out of the box. For production use, set a custom `ENCRYPTION_KEY` environment variable.

4. Create DynamoDB tables:

**Users Table:**
```bash
aws dynamodb create-table \
  --table-name therapeutic-wave-users \
  --attribute-definitions \
    AttributeName=userId,AttributeType=S \
    AttributeName=isAnonymous,AttributeType=S \
    AttributeName=lastActiveAt,AttributeType=S \
  --key-schema AttributeName=userId,KeyType=HASH \
  --global-secondary-indexes '[
    {
      "IndexName": "isAnonymous-lastActiveAt-index",
      "KeySchema": [
        {"AttributeName":"isAnonymous","KeyType":"HASH"},
        {"AttributeName":"lastActiveAt","KeyType":"RANGE"}
      ],
      "Projection": {"ProjectionType":"ALL"}
    }
  ]' \
  --billing-mode PAY_PER_REQUEST \
  --region us-east-1

```

**Sessions Table:**
```bash
aws dynamodb create-table \
  --table-name therapeutic-wave-sessions \
  --attribute-definitions \
    AttributeName=sessionId,AttributeType=S \
    AttributeName=GSI1PK,AttributeType=S \
    AttributeName=GSI1SK,AttributeType=S \
  --key-schema AttributeName=sessionId,KeyType=HASH \
  --global-secondary-indexes '[
    {
      "IndexName": "userId-startTime-index",
      "KeySchema": [
        {"AttributeName":"GSI1PK","KeyType":"HASH"},
        {"AttributeName":"GSI1SK","KeyType":"RANGE"}
      ],
      "Projection": {"ProjectionType":"ALL"}
    }
  ]' \
  --billing-mode PAY_PER_REQUEST \
  --region us-east-1

```

5. Build the TypeScript code:
```bash
npm run build
```

### Quick Start
1. Start the server:
```bash
npm start
```

2. Open your browser:
```
http://localhost:3000
```

3. **Enter your name** (or remain anonymous) and begin your therapeutic journey
4. **Grant microphone permissions** when prompted
5. **Start speaking** - Hope will listen and respond with voice and understanding

## üó£Ô∏è How to Use Hope

### **First Time Users**
1. **Introduce yourself** - Share your name or stay anonymous
2. **Start simple** - "Hello" or "I'm having a difficult day"
3. **Take your time** - Hope is patient and won't rush you
4. **Be honest** - Share what feels comfortable

### **Returning Users**
- Hope will **remember you** and reference previous conversations
- Ask **"What did we talk about before?"** to continue where you left off
- Hope tracks your **emotional journey** and progress over time

### **During Conversations**
- **Speak naturally** - No special commands needed
- **Take pauses** - Hope understands silence and processing time
- **Ask for help** - "Can you help me calm down?" or "I need grounding techniques"
- **Set boundaries** - "I don't want to talk about that today"

## Data Flow
The application processes audio input through a pipeline that converts speech to text, processes it with AWS Bedrock, and returns both text and audio responses.

```ascii
User Speech -> Browser ‚Üí Server ‚Üí Client
     ‚Üë                               ‚Üì
     ‚îÇ                   Amazon Nova Sonic Model
     ‚îÇ                               ‚Üì
Audio Output ‚Üê Browser ‚Üê Server ‚Üê Client
```

Key flow components:
1. User speaks into the microphone through Browser
2. Audio is streamed through Server to Client
3. Client sends audio to Amazon Nova Sonic Model
4. Nova Sonic processes audio and generates AI response
5. Response is sent back through client to server to browser
6. Browser plays audio response to user
