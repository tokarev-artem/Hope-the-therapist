# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature transforms the existing chat-based web interface of the speech-to-speech bot into a calming, wave-based visual animation system. The interface is specifically designed to be therapeutic and suitable for users with post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), providing a soothing visual experience during listening and speaking interactions. The wave animations will replace the traditional chat interface while maintaining all core speech-to-speech functionality.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user with PTSD, I want to see calming wave animations instead of a chat interface, so that I can have a more therapeutic and less overwhelming interaction experience.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application loads THEN the system SHALL display a wave-based animation interface instead of the current chat interface
2. WHEN the user is not actively speaking or listening THEN the system SHALL show gentle, slow-moving baseline wave animations
3. WHEN the wave animations are displayed THEN they SHALL use calming colors (soft blues, greens, or warm earth tones) that are known to reduce anxiety
4. IF the user has PTSD-related sensitivities THEN the system SHALL avoid rapid flashing, jarring movements, or high-contrast color changes

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want the wave animations to respond to my voice input, so that I can see visual feedback that the system is listening to me.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user starts speaking THEN the system SHALL transition the wave animation to reflect voice input activity
2. WHEN the user's voice amplitude increases THEN the wave animation SHALL respond with proportionally larger wave movements
3. WHEN the user's voice frequency changes THEN the wave animation SHALL reflect these changes through wave pattern variations
4. WHEN the user stops speaking THEN the system SHALL smoothly transition back to the baseline wave animation within 2-3 seconds

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want the wave animations to show when the bot is speaking, so that I can visually understand when the system is responding to me.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the bot begins speaking THEN the system SHALL display distinct wave animations that indicate system output
2. WHEN the bot is speaking THEN the wave animations SHALL be visually different from user input animations (different color, pattern, or movement style)
3. WHEN the bot's speech amplitude varies THEN the wave animation SHALL reflect these variations in real-time
4. WHEN the bot finishes speaking THEN the system SHALL smoothly return to the baseline wave animation

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user with PTSD, I want smooth and predictable animation transitions, so that I don't experience visual triggers or anxiety from sudden changes.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN any animation state changes THEN the system SHALL use smooth transitions lasting at least 500ms
2. WHEN transitioning between states THEN the system SHALL avoid sudden jumps, flashes, or abrupt color changes
3. WHEN animations are running THEN the system SHALL maintain consistent frame rates to avoid stuttering or jarring movements
4. IF the system detects performance issues THEN it SHALL gracefully reduce animation complexity while maintaining smoothness

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user, I want the wave interface to maintain all existing speech-to-speech functionality, so that I can continue to use the bot's core features with the new visual interface.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN using the wave interface THEN the system SHALL maintain all existing audio input processing capabilities
2. WHEN using the wave interface THEN the system SHALL maintain all existing speech synthesis and output capabilities
3. WHEN the wave interface is active THEN the system SHALL preserve all existing conversation flow and response logic
4. WHEN errors occur THEN the system SHALL provide visual feedback through wave animation changes (such as gentle color shifts) rather than text-based error messages

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a user, I want the wave animations to be accessible and customizable, so that I can adjust the visual experience to my specific needs and preferences.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user accesses settings THEN the system SHALL provide options to adjust wave animation intensity (amplitude scaling)
2. WHEN the user accesses settings THEN the system SHALL provide options to choose from different calming color palettes
3. WHEN the user has motion sensitivity THEN the system SHALL provide an option to reduce animation movement while maintaining visual feedback
4. WHEN accessibility settings are changed THEN the system SHALL apply changes immediately without requiring a page refresh
