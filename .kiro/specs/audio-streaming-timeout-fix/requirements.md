# Requirements Document

## Introduction

Fix the AWS Bedrock Nova Sonic streaming timeout issue that occurs when there are gaps longer than 59 seconds between audio chunks or interactive content. The system currently fails with "Timed out waiting for audio bytes or interactive content" errors from the Bedrock streaming service, disrupting therapeutic sessions.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user having a therapeutic conversation, I want the audio streaming to remain stable during natural pauses in conversation, so that my session doesn't get interrupted by timeout errors.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN there is a gap in user speech longer than 45 seconds THEN the system SHALL send keepalive audio data to prevent Bedrock Nova Sonic timeout
2. WHEN the user is silent for extended periods THEN the system SHALL maintain the streaming connection without errors
3. WHEN audio streaming is active THEN gaps between audio chunks SHALL never exceed 59 seconds
4. WHEN keepalive audio is sent THEN it SHALL NOT interfere with actual user speech recognition by Nova Sonic

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want my therapeutic sessions to handle natural conversation pauses gracefully, so that I can take time to think without technical interruptions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user pauses speaking for up to 2 minutes THEN the system SHALL maintain the connection automatically
2. WHEN keepalive mechanisms are active THEN they SHALL be transparent to the user experience
3. WHEN the user resumes speaking after a pause THEN the system SHALL immediately process their audio without delay
4. WHEN the session is active THEN the system SHALL provide visual feedback about connection status

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want proper error handling and recovery for audio streaming issues, so that sessions can continue even if temporary network or service issues occur.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a Bedrock Nova Sonic timeout occurs THEN the system SHALL attempt to reconnect automatically
2. WHEN reconnection fails THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages to the user
3. WHEN audio streaming errors occur THEN the system SHALL log detailed information for debugging
4. WHEN the connection is restored THEN the user SHALL be notified and can continue their session
