# Implementation Plan

- [x] 1. Fix Load Balancer Configuration for WebSocket Support
  - Update ALB configuration to properly handle WebSocket connections with extended timeouts
  - Configure sticky sessions to ensure WebSocket connections stay with the same ECS task
  - Set appropriate health check configurations for long-lived connections
  - _Requirements: 1.2, 2.1, 3.1_

- [x] 1.1 Update ALB timeout and WebSocket settings
  - Modify `infrastructure/hope-therapeutic-stack.ts` to set ALB idle timeout to 300 seconds (5 minutes)
  - Enable sticky sessions with cookie-based session affinity for WebSocket connections
  - Configure target group for WebSocket support with proper health checks
  - _Requirements: 1.2, 2.1_

- [x] 1.2 Configure target group health checks for ECS
  - Set health check path to `/health` with appropriate intervals (30 seconds)
  - Configure healthy/unhealthy thresholds for stable connections (2/5)
  - Set health check timeout to handle container startup delays (10 seconds)
  - _Requirements: 3.1, 3.2_
